                    It is believed that the most important components are the physical forms of the diet and exercise regimen. But we underestimate another important factor - the son. Many of the best athletes in the world say it is part of their training area and key frequencies to help them fight well. Tom Brady says he goes to bed early and gets at least nine hours of sleep. , growth and repair of tissues (such as our muscles), as well as getting memory work, reaction time and decision making. All these processes take place on sports results. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been found to reverse these impairments in the short term (within five days). But it's currently unclear how these disruptions will affect exercise adaptation in the long term, so if you're looking to increase your endurance, your best bet is to normalize your sleepiness. Muscle growth occurs when new proteins are added to muscle tissue, a process known as muscle protein synthesis. This process stimulates increased food intake and food intake (particularly protein) and can last at least 24 hours after exercise. This suggests that poor sleep can make it harder to build muscle mass. Muscles store glucose from the foods we eat in the form of glycogen in order to have a high exercise requirement. Replenishing glycogen stores after exercise is a key part of the recovery process. With proper consumption of increased consumption up to 24 hours to fully replenish its reserves. This may be helpful for replenishing glycogen stores. One study found a decrease in muscle glycogen stores after a night of sleep deprivation.
